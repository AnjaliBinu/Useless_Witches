### Project Description
Always Wrong Calculator : 
Launching a Calculator that is processed to get two numbers from the user to do four types of arithmetic operations . However , the twist comes during the execution of the code , when asked to do addition ,  the stupid calculator may do division or whichever arithmetic operator the computer prefers.‚Ä¶. Hence , the name Always Wrong Calculator .

Twister Calendar :
Presenting a Calendar that has more holidays than working days , favorable to all students and lazy bums . It is charismatic , has minimal working days , new names for each day of the week with lots of emojis .

Animistic World Map : 
Introducing a map that has a mind of its own . The user has the ability to show a country on the map which they prefer , nonetheless , the stubborn map only displays the country which the computer chooses .
 
The Capsized Clock : 
Exhibiting an emotional clock , it may always be wrong , it could be too emotional . Despite that , I bet this clock would make anyone's day. 

Summary : 
The user is given the ability to choose any of the given applications from above . Nevertheless , the pig-headed computer chooses the option preferable to them.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
